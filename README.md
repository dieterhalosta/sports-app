# Sports App
A simple app to create and book a sports event from a catalog of events.

# Inspiration
I wanted to consolidate the principles that I learned during my Java Bootcamp and this is also my certification project.
So I created the back end for this app using Java with Spring Boot and MySQL.

# Development stack
+ [Java]
+ [Spring Boot] for the features this framework provides when writng code.
